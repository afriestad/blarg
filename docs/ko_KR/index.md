# Destiny 2: 빛의 저편 ARG
**우리가 지금까지 알아낸 것**.

[빛의 저편 콜렉터스 에디션 (Collector's Edition | CE)](https://eu.bungiestore.com/collections/collectors-edition/products/preorder-destiny-2-beyond-light-collectors-edition-no-game-code) 에는 가방, 물통, 사운드트랙 (디지털), 스티커, 엽서, 편지/보고서, "수수께끼의 일지", 그리고 피라미드 함선 동상이 들어있습니다.

이 중에서, 우리는 엽서와 편지/보고서, 피라미드, 일지에서 흥미로운 것을 발견했습니다.

## 흥미로운 물건들

### 피라미드 동상
공식 사용설명서에서 "파편"이라고 부르는 이 동상은 4개의 모드를 가지고 있습니다: 켜기, 호흡, 코드, 끄기. 코드 모드에서는 짧은 점멸, 긴 점멸, 맥동 점멸의 조합으로 약 1분 정도의 반복 패턴으로 깜박입니다. 이 코드는 뚫렸습니다. [피라미드 코드 보기.](#the-code-from-the-pyramid)

### 엽서

_이미지 제공: Bachmanetti ([트위터](https://twitter.com/bachmanetti), [레딧](https://www.reddit.com/u/bachmanetti). [원본 PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ie8Iiycnx6vQCKz2JwtBFfahvJHUyTaM/view)의 2페이지 스크린샷._

엽서에는 다음과 같은 세 부분으로 구성된 빨간 글자가 일렬로 있습니다: `ca 0 1 9 9 1 0707 B´ID`, `N N N - N N N - N N N`, `S T R   D ST`
첫 번째와 세 번째 부분은 모든 엽서가 동일합니다. 두 번째 부분은 각 엽서의 고유 코드이고, [bungie.net/redeem](https://bungie.net/redeem)에서 문양으로 바꿀 수 있는 문양 코드입니다. **이 코드는 일회용입니다! 코드를 사용하기 전에 다른 사람과 공유하지 마십시오!**

첫 번째 부분은 번지에 대한 내용인 것 같습니다. (회사 설립일은 1991년이고, 0707 (7월 7일) 은 번지의 날 입니다)

세 번째 부분은 "Stardust"에 대한 언급인 것 같습니다. "Stardust"는 번지 내부 코드네임으로 소문이 나 있습니다. 출현의 시즌, 그리고 빛의 저편을 위한 것입니다. 이 모습은 후자를 뒷받침하는 것 같습니다. 아홉이 유로파에 관심을 가진다는 것을 암시하는 것 일 수도 있습니다. ([편지/선봉대 보고서](#the-letter)에 자세히 설명되있음).

[여기](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ie8Iiycnx6vQCKz2JwtBFfahvJHUyTaM/view?usp=sharing)에서 전체 내용을 볼 수 있습니다.  (구글 드라이브, Bachmanetti 제공)

### 편지
편지는 두 종류입니다: "CHA-319"가 유로파 탐험 금지에 대한 선봉대 보고서와 뒷면의 손편지. 손편지에는 클로비스 브레이를 "할아버지"로 언급하고 있으며, 편지 서명에는 "Your stanger I remain, E"라고 적혀있습니다. 이것은 엑소 스트레인져가 엘사 브레이 라는것을 확인시켜줍니다.

### 일지
일지는 총 46장이고, 클로비스 브레이의 유로파 탐험과 엑소 작업을 자세하게 설명합니다. 그것은 많은 퍼즐과 로어가 들어있으며, 그의 손자인 엘사와 아나, 윌라에게 보내는 편지도 있습니다. 빌어먹을, 이건 읽는 거에요. 모든 걸 살펴보는걸 추천합니다. 지금까지 저희가 발견한 모든 퍼즐은 이 일지에서 나온 것입니다. 그리고 분명 더 많은 것들이 있을 겁니다. 왜냐면 이 안에 넘치게 많은 암호화된 이미지들이 있기 떄문입니다.

All text from the logbook also exists [here (Google Docs)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NHsZL5YRzG-NeyvMczOkEe7g01e2Vb9CKyx7-g6vUgY/edit), courtesy of Eruke (Eruke#7280 on Discord). It is all copypastable, and well formatted!

## The Solutions
There are several puzzles. Most are found in the logbook, so far. We have solved some.

### The Code from the Pyramid
The solution to this mystery can be found by combining the blinking of the pyramid on Code mode with the table on Page 1.

![The first page of the Logbook. There is a table with 5 rows and 23 columns. To the right of each row is a number. Top left of the table is the number 0](assets/img/logbook-pg1-cutout-1.jpg)

_Image credit: Bachmanetti ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/bachmanetti), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/bachmanetti)). Screenshot from page 2 of [original PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ib5OXH3UQr-6eG-eXlQEvMjsdV1p2Y45/view)._

To the left of the first row of the table is the number 0.
To the right of the table, one on each row, we find the following numbers:

```
11350
22699
34050
45399
56750
```

Additionally, underneath the table, we see three outline drawings of The Splinter. Pointing to one of these, conspicuously in the same place as the on-button of the statue, is a sequence of four dots. The third of these dots is filled. Remember that the third mode of the Splinter is the Code mode, which means that the Splinter is likely a part of the solution to this puzzle!

[Here is a 63 second video of the Splinter blinking](https://twitter.com/i/status/1318568351665442817), courtesy of Melmsie ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/realmelmsie)). Note the softer "pulsing" blinks that appear about every 11 seconds.

~~![66-second video of the splinter blinking](assets/video/bachmanetti-shard-66s.mp4)~~ Embedding doesn't work :(

Bachmanetti figured out that the numbers to the left of the table are timestamps (in milliseconds), and that they correspond with the pulsing type of blinking. Dividing the milliseconds by the amount of columns (for instance, 11350 ms / 23 columns ≈ 500 ms/col ), we find that each cell in the table roughly corresponds to half a second. If we jump half a second at a time on the video and fill the cells that correspond to a lit shard, we get the following result:

![The same table with several cells filled](assets/img/choose.png)

This spells out CHOOSE. (Dzho actually noticed the split into five sequences and made this image before Bachmanetti realized the numbers are timestamps)

There is a hint about where we can use this code, too. Underneath the table is the following text:

```
> ht
  tps:
  //b.n
  et/analyze
```

This is easily understood as [https://bungie.net/analyze](https://bungie.net/analyze), which indeed is a webpage that contains a code entry field.

To fill in the code, one must be logged in to Bungie.net and have redeemed one of the CE postcard codes (in essence, you must be an owner of the CE). If you do this (and wait a bit for the sync to update your permissions in the background somewhere), then entering "CHOOSE" into the field will give you a screen like the following:

![Screenshot of bungie.net/analyze after successfull code entry](assets/img/bungie-net-analyze.png)

This is a countdown, specifically counting down to **Thursday Nov 5 at 11 AM PDT** (18:00 UTC, one hour after reset). This seems to be a countdown. If you are a CE owner, check back on the page after the countdown ends! Chances are this will be the start of the ARG proper, and that we will get instructions for the next step on this page.

**NOTE: The page doesn't seem to work properly on mobile. If you are having trouble, try entering the code using another browser or from a computer.**

### Emblem Codes
Most of the puzzles so far have resulted in emblem codes. There is also one emblem code that is unique to owners of the CE.

#### (CE Owners Only) The postcard
There is a code printed on the postcard which is _single use_ and unique for each postcard. It can be redeemed on [bungie.net/redeem](https://bungie.net/redeem). See [The Postcard](#the-postcard) for how to find the code.

#### (Everyone) The Tube/Rod Puzzle
There are tubes/rods on pages 16 and 27 in the logbook. Page 16 contains the following:

![Cutout from page 16 with rods and corresponding letters](assets/img/logbook-pg16-cutout-1.jpg)

_Image credit: Bachmanetti ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/bachmanetti), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/bachmanetti)). Screenshot from page 16 of [original PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ib5OXH3UQr-6eG-eXlQEvMjsdV1p2Y45/view)._

Page 27 contains the following:

![Cutout from page 27 with three rods comprised of smaller rods](assets/img/logbook-pg27-cutout-1.png)

_Image credit: Bachmanetti ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/bachmanetti), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/bachmanetti)). Screenshot from page 27 of [original PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ib5OXH3UQr-6eG-eXlQEvMjsdV1p2Y45/view)._

The rods on page 27 are each comprised of several smaller rods. If we use the legend from page 16 to translate to letters, we get the following three sequences:

```
67S6K99
37XP7AJ7X6J
RA9XPH6KJ
```

There is an arrow pointing at the rightmost rod, and the code is indeed 9 characters long: `RA9-XPH-6KJ`. This is an emblem code, redeem it at [bungie.net/redeem](https://bungie.net/redeem)!

#### (Everyone) The Dot Letter Puzzle
On page 28 of the logbook, we find the following configuration:

![Cutout from page 28 with many dots, some of which have letters by them](assets/img/logbook-pg28-cutout-1.png)

_Image credit: Bachmanetti ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/bachmanetti), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/bachmanetti)). Screenshot from page 28 of [original PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ib5OXH3UQr-6eG-eXlQEvMjsdV1p2Y45/view)._

On page 12, we find the same dot configuration, but without the letters:

![Cutout from page 12 with many dots, and a line going through several of them](assets/img/logbook-pg12-cutout-1.png)

_Image credit: Bachmanetti ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/bachmanetti), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/bachmanetti)). Screenshot from page 12 of [original PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ib5OXH3UQr-6eG-eXlQEvMjsdV1p2Y45/view)._

However, the dot pattern on page 12 has a line going through it! If we start in the hollowed out dot and follow the line to the end, noting down letters as we pass through their corresponding node, we get the following sequence: `JYNJAAY7D`. This is 9 characters! Go ahead and redeem `JYN-JAA-Y7D` at [bungie.net/redeem](https://bungie.net/redeem).

#### (Everyone) The Graph Puzzle
Page 39 of the logbook contains the following graph:

![Cutout from page 39 of a graph, the y axis labled 0 at the bottom and Z at the top](assets/img/logbook-pg39-cutout-1.png)

_Image credit: Bachmanetti ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/bachmanetti), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/bachmanetti)). Screenshot from page 39 of [original PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ib5OXH3UQr-6eG-eXlQEvMjsdV1p2Y45/view)._

The Y axis is labled 0 at the bottom and Z at the top. The axis has 36 marks, which corresponds to `0-9` and `A-Z`. If we mark the axis like this, counting upwards like `012...89ABC...YZ`, and mark down the points on the graph line from left to right, you get the following Y-indices: `7 21 31 16 29 20 29 7 19`, which correspond to the string `7LVGTKT7J` (`10` is `A`, `11` is `B`, and so on). This code is 9 characters long! We can redeem `7LV-GTK-T7J` at [bungie.net/redeem](https://bungie.net/redeem).

## The Unsolved Mysteries
As you have probably gathered, there are probably more puzzles hidden here. There are patterns in the screenshots above I have not mentioned, and many more elsewhere in the logbook. What do they mean? We don't know! Come to the #beyond-light-arg channel on the RaidSecrets Discord if you are interested in helping out with finding and solving them!

I am also a part of the Corridor Crunch discord, where we made a crowdsourcing engine for the Corridors of Time puzzle. We want to do the same for this ARG, and to gather puzzle enthusiasts on [our Discord channel](https://discord.gg/W9Uwgqv). If you are interested in helping with the crowdsourcing, development or puzzling, join us!

## The Dead Ends
We've looked so diligently we even found mysteries where there were none. I list them here.

### 4K Background Maze/Game of Life
Someone noticed a weird maze-like structure in the upper left hand corner of the following image:

![Beyond Light 4K Background](https://www.bungie.net/7/ca/destiny/products/beyondlight/media_wallpaper_1.png)

_Image credit: Bungie. [Original](https://www.bungie.net/7/ca/destiny/products/beyondlight/media_wallpaper_1.png)._

It was theorized that this might have something to do with Conway's Game of Life. However, Cozmo confirmed on Reddit that [this is just an image compression artefact](https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/jekt2x/beyond_light_wallpaper_game_of_life_investigation/g9kjexg).
